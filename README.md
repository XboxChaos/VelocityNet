VelocityNet
===========

.NET wrapper for Velocity's backend, written in C++/CLI. Currently only supports basic STFS package management, but more features are on the way.

Velocity was written by Stevie Hetelekides (Hetelek/sh042067) and Adam Spindler (Experiment5X).
Some very minor changes were made to the XboxInternals code in order to make it compile with Visual Studio.
Its original source code can be found at <https://github.com/hetelek/velocity>.
